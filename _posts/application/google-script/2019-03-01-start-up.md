# Google Script
Google service, let you create some script/macro for your documents/mail/calendar/...
it based on javascript, and the site is:
```
script: https://script.google.com
advance google service api: https://console.cloud.google.com
```

## reference development documents
Google release the development reference documents in
```
https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/
```
we can find the development api in there.

## how to create a new script
it have 2 methods to create new script:

### create new script from script.google.com
click 'new script' from https://script.google.com, then give it a project name

### create new script from documents
in your documents (sheets, writer, ...), choose "Script editor" from menu/Tools,
and give it a project name

## how to debug a script
it have many methods, I give 2 methods in here, add the code to your scripts:

### Logger
```javascript
e.g.
Logger.log('string');
Logger.log('string: %s', xxx);
```
and it will be shown in menu/View/Logs

### console
```javascript
e.g.
console.info('string');
console.info('string: %s', xxx);
```

and it will be shown in menu/View/Stackdriver logging

## how to run the script
### run function from script editor
the most easy way, you just use the menu/Run/Run Function in your script editor

### run function from additional menu in your documents
before you start run the function, you have to add a additional menu to your documents,
following is the example code:

* first you need crate a function with function name -- onOpen
* this example is using google sheet

```javascript
function onOpen() {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();
  var menuItems = [
    {name: 'example', functionName: 'example'}
  ];

  sheet.addMenu('just sample', menuItems);
}
```

* second, create the function "example"

```javascript
function example() {
  console.info('run example');
}
```

then you need reopen your documents (close it then open again), after this
you can run the script by using menu/just sample/example

### run function from trigger events
there 2 way to register a new trigger event, and google provides many kind of events
to use.

#### register by script.google.com
open one of projects from your script.google.com, you can find the menu in "..." icon,
choose "trigger", then you just following the dialog to select the current function and
trigger evnets for your script.

#### register by function
in this case, you only need run the code just once, the trigger will be stay in your
trigger list till you remove it.
the code will be:

* this example is using calendar event

```javascript
function registerTrigger() {
  ScriptApp.newTrigger('triggerExample')
    .forUserCalendar('xxx@gmail.com')
    .onEventUpdated()
    .create();
}

function triggerExample(trigger_event) {
  console.info('trigger event: %s', trigger_event);
}
```
